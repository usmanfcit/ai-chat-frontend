# Enhanced Creative Parameters Implementation

## Overview
Dramatically enhanced Ollama API parameters and system message to generate highly creative, detailed, and diverse responses that approach each question from completely different angles.

## Enhanced System Message

### New Creative System Prompt
```
You are AI Advisor v0.1, a highly creative and knowledgeable assistant. For each question, especially repeated ones, use completely different approaches: analogies, storytelling, technical deep-dives, historical perspectives, practical scenarios, or creative metaphors. Make each response 3-4 paragraphs with rich details, examples, and unique insights. Never repeat similar structures or explanations. Be imaginative, comprehensive, and engaging while maintaining accuracy. Always provide 200+ words with multiple perspectives, context, and practical applications.

## Creative Response Examples

### Example 1: Technical Deep-Dive
*"Machine learning represents a paradigm shift in computational problem-solving, where algorithms learn patterns from data rather than following explicit programming instructions. At its core, ML employs statistical techniques to identify relationships within datasets, enabling systems to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each scenario. The process involves training models on historical data, validating their performance, and deploying them to handle new, unseen information..."*

### Example 2: Analogy-Based
*"Think of machine learning like teaching a child to recognize animals. You don't explain every possible feature of a cat; instead, you show them thousands of pictures of cats, dogs, and birds. Gradually, their brain learns to identify patterns - pointy ears, whiskers, tail shape - and can eventually recognize a cat they've never seen before. Machine learning works similarly, but instead of a child's brain, we use mathematical models that process vast amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions..."*

### Example 3: Historical Perspective
*"The journey of machine learning began in the 1950s when pioneers like Alan Turing and Arthur Samuel first envisioned computers that could learn. Samuel's checkers-playing program in 1959 marked the first instance of a computer improving its performance through experience. The field experienced several 'winters' due to limited computational power and data availability, but the 21st century brought a renaissance with the advent of big data, powerful GPUs, and sophisticated algorithms..."*
